				<p>I'm 21 years old and non-binary so I use they/them pronouns! Kendall is my legal name, however I usually prefer to go by Ashley or Ash. I live on my own and just finished my first big home improvement project, which was painting my computer room. There's also 6 cats that live with me that were all strays I have rescued with my partner. I also have two dogs, Sterling the corgi and Poe the rat terrier. I got into coding through taking classes in high school, and ever since then I have continued to code off and on to keep my skills sharp. I've mostly only worked in Java however so I have a lot of learning to do in the other languages we'll be using in this class, such as the html and css used for this page.</p>
